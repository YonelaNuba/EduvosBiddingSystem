            <p style="color: #333; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
                A bid is an offer made by an individual or entity to buy products, services, or contracts for a set price.
                Bids are typically made in competitive settings where the highest or most strategic bid wins. 
                Online bidding allows buyers to auction items and participants to place bids in real time, where the highest bid wins.
